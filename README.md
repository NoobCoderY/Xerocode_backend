Step 1: Signin/Signup System using JWT with Redis and MongoDB

1. Set up a Node.js server using Express.js.
2. Use Passport.js for authentication strategies, including local (username/password), Google OAuth, and GitHub OAuth.
3. Use jsonwebtoken (JWT) for token creation and validation.
4. Use Redis to store JWT metadata (such as expiration time, user ID, etc.).
5. Use MongoDB to store user credentials (username, password hash, etc.).
6. Create routes for /signup, /signin, /auth/google, and /auth/github.

Step 2: User Type Selection

1. After successful signup/signin, display user type selection options (Developer, Organization, Company) on the frontend.
2. Store the selected user type in MongoDB associated with the user's profile.

Step 3: Hosting Option Selection

1. Display hosting options (Self Hosting, XeroCode Hosting) on the frontend after user type selection.
2. If Self Hosting is selected, show further options (AWS, GitHub).
3. Store the selected hosting option in MongoDB associated with the user's profile.

Step 4: GitHub App Integration

1. If GitHub is selected as a hosting option, redirect the user to the GitHub App installation page.
2. Implement GitHub OAuth flow to integrate with GitHub Apps API and obtain necessary permissions.
3. Once the GitHub App is installed, use API calls to fetch the user's public and private repositories.
4. Display the list of repositories on the frontend.
5-Only show gitrepo of user if user login with github and select option github as a deployment.


Important Considerations:

1. Security: Implement secure practices throughout, including password hashing, JWT validation, and securing API keys.
2. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for all API calls and database interactions.
3. User Experience: Ensure a smooth and intuitive user interface for user interaction and feedback.
4. Scalability: Design the system with scalability in mind, considering potential increases in user base and repository data.
5. Documentation: Create clear documentation for both the frontend and backend codebase.
6. Testing: Thoroughly test each component, including authentication flows, API integrations, and data storage.
7. Deployment: Deploy the frontend and backend components to appropriate hosting services.
